MICROSWIPE

Have you ever needed to add swipe functionality for iOS devices but not wanted to import huge libraries to do so?

MICROSWIPE works without any external libraries, but works just fine as a jQuery plugin as well.

Usage

On its own:

```new MicroSwipe({id:[MY_ELEMENT's ID],onSwipeComplete:CALLBACK});```

jQuery:

```$([MY_ELEMENT]).microswipe(CALLBACK,[OPTS]);```
